## RT-REST

This is a fork of the original repo - mainly to interact
with our own RT - yet, we (https://github.com/bytemine) wanted to
make sure, that if we fix or enhance something it is available.

To contact us: code@bytemine.net

# Contents of original README.md

To see RT-REST in action simply open your terminal and execute:

```
git clone git@github.com:bboksa/RT-REST.git
cd RT-REST
mvn test
```

Using it in your code is just as simple, see

https://github.com/bboksa/RT-REST/blob/master/src/test/java/de/boksa/rt/test/dao/RESTRTTicketDAOTest.java

for a demo.
